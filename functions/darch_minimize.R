#' Minimize a differentiable multivariate function. 
#' 
#' This function is a direct translation from the Matlab source code of the 
#' minimize function from Carl Edward Rasmussen.
#' 
#' @details
#' Minimize a differentiable multivariate function.
#' 
#' Usage: [X, fX, i] <- minimize(X, f, length, P1, P2, P3, ... )
#' 
#' where the starting point is given by "X" (D by 1), and the function named in
#' the string "f", must return a function value and a vector of partial
#' derivatives of f wrt X, the "length" gives the length of the run: if it is
#' positive, it gives the maximum number of line searches, if negative its
#' absolute gives the maximum allowed number of function evaluations. You can
#' (optionally) give "length" a second component, which will indicate the
#' reduction in function value to be expected in the first line-search (defaults
#' to 1.0). The parameters P1, P2, P3, ... are passed on to the function f.
#' 
#' The function returns when either its length is up, or if no further progress
#' can be made (ie, we are at a (local) minimum, or so close that due to
#' numerical problems, we cannot get any closer). NOTE: If the function
#' terminates within a few iterations, it could be an indication that the
#' function values and derivatives are not consistent (i.e., there may be a bug in
#' the implementation of your "f" function). The function returns the found
#' solution "X", a vector of function values "fX" indicating the progress made
#' and "i" the number of iterations (line searches or function evaluations,
#' depending on the sign of "length") used.
#
#' The Polack-Ribiere flavour of conjugate gradients is used to compute search
#' directions, and a line search using quadratic and cubic polynomial
#' approximations and the Wolfe-Powell stopping criteria is used together with
#' the slope ratio method for guessing initial step sizes. Additionally a bunch
#' of checks are made to make sure that exploration is taking place and that
#' extrapolation will not be unboundedly large.

  RHO <- SIG/2 # SIG and RHO are the constants controlling the Wolfe-
  # Powell conditions. SIG is the maximum allowed absolute ratio between
  # previous and new slopes (derivatives in the search direction), thus setting
  # SIG to low (positive) values forces higher precision in the line-searches.
  # RHO is the minimum allowed fraction of the expected (from the slope at the
  # initial point in the linesearch). Constants must satisfy 0 < RHO < SIG < 1.
  # Tuning of SIG (depending on the nature of the function to be optimized) may
  # speed up the minimization it is probably not worth playing much with RHO.
  
  # The code falls naturally into 3 parts, after the initial line search is
  # started in the direction of steepest descent. 1) we first enter a while loop
  # which uses point 1 (p1) and (p2) to compute an extrapolation (p3), until we
  # have extrapolated far enough (Wolfe-Powell conditions). 2) if necessary, we
  # enter the second loop which takes p2, p3 and p4 chooses the subinterval
  # containing a (local) minimum, and interpolates it, unil an acceptable point
  # is found (Wolfe-Powell conditions). Note, that points are always maintained
  # in order p0 <<- p1 <<- p2 < p3 < p4. 3) compute a new search direction using
  # conjugate gradients (Polack-Ribiere flavour), or revert to steepest if there
  # was a problem in the previous line-search. Return the best value so far, if
  # two consecutive line-searches fail, or whenever we run out of function
  # evaluations or line-searches. During extrapolation, the "f" function may fail
  # either with an error or returning Nan or Inf, and minimize should handle this
  # gracefully.
